# Quantum Circuit Simulator

This project demonstrates a simple quantum circuit simulator using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and Streamlit. It allows you to build quantum circuits, add gates, and visualize results in real time.

## Features
- Create and initialize circuits
- Add common quantum gates (H, X, Y, Z, CNOT, etc.)
- Execute circuits with Qiskit simulators
- Plot Bloch spheres and measurement outcomes

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Pandas

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the App
    ```bash
    streamlit run CircuitSimulator7.py
    ```
3. Open the provided local URL in your browser to interact with the simulator
